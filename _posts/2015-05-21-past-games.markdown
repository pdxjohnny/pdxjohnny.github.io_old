Here's a compilation of some of my unfinished games just so I don't forget about them. The civ one moves the map if you tilt your phone, whoa crazy I know right. Don't have too much fun.

( Don't try to make anything with a city trust me the tab will stop responding, I've done the most work on this its a remake of civ 5 or what ever civ beyond earth too could be I was adding support for all sorts of mods. )

[Space][space-url]

( pretty cool concept in my head i wanted to make like a ship builder and stuff and have planets and make space stations, the other ship is actually another player thats in a "logged off" state, as I said unfinished. )

[RTS][js-rts-url]

( This is my favorite, its an rts which means that you build the ships and there are the enemies that come from the corner, unfinished very, and then you can make them move around, it would be cool but it gets slow with too many units )
